# My Cool E-commerce Back End
  ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
 
  ## Description
  The motivation for making this back end was to get introduced to what an e-commerce back end would look like and to get comfrotable with working with it. It uses and Express.js API using Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. While working on this, I learned more about Sequelize, and I also learned that I need to make sure to pay close attention to detail when coding.

  ## Installation
  Dotenv 8.2.0, Express 4.17.1, MySQL2 2.1.0, and Sequelize 5.21.7.
 
  ## Usage
  To use this application, clone the repository and then get in the repository and run "npm i -s" in the terminal. After you have downloaded the dependencies, change the .env file to have your information for MySQL. After that you need to run "\. schema.sql" once you are in the database in your MySQL shell. Go back to your terminal and run "node seeds". After that is done, run "node server.js" in your terminal and go to Port 3001!
